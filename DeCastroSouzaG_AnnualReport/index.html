				<p>
				Our company’s strategy has been – and continues to be – to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets, with Guyana as our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines. Guyana will become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil developments come online, which we believe will drive our company’s breakeven price below $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. <br><br>
				Throughout the pandemic, our company has maintained a constant focus on the safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate. In response to the pandemic’s severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. For 2021, we have hedged 120,000 barrels per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options.

		To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, in March and April of 2020 when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered three very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to store and transport more than 6 million barrels of Bakken crude oil to high value markets in Asia; all three cargoes were sold at a premium to Brent.
		<br><br>
		We reduced our 2020 capital and exploratory budget from $3 billion down to $1.8 billion, primarily by dropping from six Bakken rigs to one. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. We further strengthened our cash and liquidity position in 2020 through a $1.0 billion, three year term loan agreement. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million. 
		<br><br>
		In terms of preserving capability, a key for us was continuing to operate one rig in the Bakken in 2020. Our Bakken team has made great progress over the past 10 years in Lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices, which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future.
		<br><br><br>
		To preserve the long term value of our assets, we allocated more than 80% of our 2021 capital and exploratory budget of $1.9 billion to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have a Brent breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel, and to the Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that can generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.
		<br><br>
		On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. Three oil discoveries during the year brought total discoveries on the block to 18. In October, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.

		Production from Liza Phase 1 reached its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in December 2020, and the Liza Phase 2 development, with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. In September 2020, we sanctioned our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024.
		<br><br>
		In the Bakken, our 2020 net production came in well above our original guidance for the year and 27% above that of 2019. As WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, in February 2021 we added a second rig, which will allow us to maintain net production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and sustain long term cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.
		<br><br>
		Turning to our 2020 financial results, our adjusted net loss was $894 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $281 million in 2019, primarily reflecting the effects of lower realized prices. Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, was $1.8 billion, compared with $2.2 billion in the prior year. Proved reserves at the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions and revisions in 2020 totaled 117 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, replacing 95% of 2020 production.

		<h2>GLOBAL OPERATIONS</h2>
		<h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
		<p>
		In 2020, our company responded quickly and decisively to the pandemic, establishing clear protocols to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in our work environment that underpinned safe and effective operations across the Hess portfolio.
		<br><br>
		Net production averaged 331,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including Libya, compared with
 		11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019. The year over year increase was the result of higher Bakken production and the first full year of production from the Liza Field on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, which was partially offset by lower production in Libya and the impacts of hurricane related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and lower energy demand in Malaysia and Thailand caused by COVID-19.
		<br><br>
		In the Bakken, Hess’ operated rig count averaged 2.6 in 2020, compared with 6.0 in 2019. In response to lower oil prices, the company safely reduced activity from six operated rigs at the start of the year to one rig by June. We brought 111 new wells on production in 2020, compared with 156 wells in 2019. Net production from the Bakken averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020, compared with 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019.
		<br><br><br><br>
		As WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second operated rig in February 2021, which will allow us, following the planned turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant this summer, to maintain Bakken net production at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and sustain long term cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.
		<br><br>
		Through the continued application of technology and Lean manufacturing techniques, we were able to reduce our average drilling and completion costs in the Bakken to $6.2 million per well in 2020, down from $6.8 million in 2019. In 2021, drilling and completion costs are expected to average below $6.0 million through continued efficiency gains driven by Lean manufacturing and technological innovation. We have fully transitioned to plug and perf completion design and continue to optimize the development of our acreage through a combination of well spacing and well completion design. The overall productivity of wells drilled in 2021 is forecast to be in line with the 2020 program, with average 180 day initial production rates of approximately 120,000 barrels of oil. Our estimate of net ultimate recovery from our Bakken acreage remains at approximately 2.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with approximately 2.0 billion barrels yet to be produced.

		<h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
		<p>
		Offshore Guyana, Hess holds a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is operator and holds a 45% interest. CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited, holds the remaining 25% interest. As a result of further exploration and appraisal success during 2020, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.<br><br><br>
		First oil from the second phase of the Liza development is on track for early 2022, utilizing the Liza Unity floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. A third development, at the Payara Field, was sanctioned in September 2020 with production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day; first oil is expected in 2024. We expect to have at least five FPSOs on the Stabroek Block by 2026 producing more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day, with the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.

		<h3>EXPLORATION</h3>
		<p>
		At the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, Hess has participated in 18 discoveries to date that are estimated to contain gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Three of these discoveries were announced in 2020. In January 2020, the Uaru-1 well encountered approximately 94 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoir. The well, drilled in 6,342 feet of water, is located approximately 10 miles northeast of the Liza Field.
		<br><br><br><br>
		In September 2020, we announced the Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 discoveries. Redtail-1 encountered approximately 232 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoir. The well is located approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Yellowtail discovery in 6,164 feet of water. Yellowtail-2 encountered approximately 69 feet of high quality, oil bearing reservoirs adjacent to and below the Yellowtail-1 discovery. The well is located approximately 1.5 miles from the Yellowtail-1 well in 5,901 feet of water. In 2021, an active exploration and appraisal program is planned that will include drilling approximately 12 wells.

				<p>
				Hess’ purpose – to be the world’s most trusted energy partner – aligns with our longstanding commitment to sustainability, which we believe creates value for all of our stakeholders. Our strategy for environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS &amp; SR) focuses on eight key areas: Climate Change; Community and Stakeholder Engagement; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Emergency Preparedness and Response; Occupational Health and Safety; Process Safety; Supply Chain and Contractor Management; and Water Management. Our EHS &amp; SR strategy and performance are discussed in detail in our sustainability report, available at www.hess.com/sustainability.
				<br><br>
				Our sustainability culture starts at the top of our company and is reinforced at every level. Our Board of Directors is climate change literate and actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ sustainability practices, working alongside senior management. The EHS Committee of our Board provides oversight and makes recommendations to the full Board with respect to Hess’ policies, positions and systems for EHS &amp; SR, compliance and risk management.
				<br><br>
				We regularly bring in subject matter experts to brief our Board on climate and other sustainability issues to be considered in the development of company strategies and policies. The Board’s Compensation and Management Development Committee has tied executive compensation to advancing the company’s EHS and climate change goals.
				<br><br>
				We recently completed a review and update of our EHS &amp; SR strategy, beginning with a materiality assessment to prioritize and focus our strategic actions through 2025, which will be discussed in our 2020 sustainability report. We have established goals and targets to drive progress in high priority areas, including climate change, and in support of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. The Board’s EHS Committee was actively involved in the update of our EHS &amp; SR strategy and will continue to oversee management’s implementation.

	<div class="container"><h3>ENVIRONMENT &amp; CLIMATE CHANGE</h3></div>
	<div class="box4"></div>
	<div class="text container">
		<p>
		We see climate change as one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century. We believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time providing the safe, affordable and reliable energy necessary to ensure human welfare and global economic development in the context of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Governments, businesses and civil society must work together on cost effective policies. We support transparent carbon pricing as an economically efficient method for managing carbon emissions.
		<br><br>
		Our climate strategy is closely aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) established by the G20 Financial Stability Board, and its implementation is led by senior members of our leadership team. Our efforts to support the transition to a low carbon economy and mitigate climate change in line with TCFD recommendations have been independently assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative, and we were the only U.S. oil and gas company to be awarded a Level 4 star rating in their September 2020 report.
		<br><br>
		In 2020, we significantly surpassed our five year targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by 25% and flaring intensity by 50% from our operated assetsn– reducing GHG emissions intensity and flaring intensity by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively, compared with 2014 levels. As part of our updated EHS &amp; SR strategy, Hess leadership and our Board have set new five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 44% from 2017 levels to 17 kg per barrel of oil equivalent and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels to an intensity of 0.19%. These targets are designed to exceed the 22% carbon intensity reduction by 2030 in the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement’s less than 2 C ambition.  Flaring reduction – particularly from our Bakken operations – is a key driver to reducing our overall GHG emissions intensity. For 2021, continued Bakken flaring reduction is one of the performance metrics in the company’s annual incentive plan. Additional EHS &amp; SR strategic actions will be discussed in our sustainability report.
		<br><br>
		In addition to addressing our direct emissions, we also seek to fund innovation with the potential to mitigate societal emissions. In 2020, we announced a gift of $12.5 million over five years to help fund the Salk Institute’s Harnessing Plants Initiative, a research and development program aimed at developing plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. We also address 100% of the indirect emissions from our purchased electricity through a combination of renewable energy generated from the grid and the purchase of renewable energy certificates.
		</p>
	</div>
</section>
	
<section id="sustainability-3" class="container">

		<p>
		We account for the cost of carbon in capital investment decisions. We conduct scenario planning that includes the Sustainable Development Scenario developed by the IEA to test the resilience of Hess’ portfolio against a range of environmental policies and market conditions. According to the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2020, oil and gas are essential to meeting the world’s growing energy. demand through 2040, taking into account a carbon constrained future. Hess’ strategic priorities – to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth – are aligned with the energy transition needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Scenario and position us well for the coming decades. We also consider physical risks associated with climate change, such as increased severity of storms, drought and flooding, for new projects and existing operations.
		<br><br>
		We understand that a substantive climate strategy requires companies to look beyond a five year time frame. We have established an executive led taskforce to consider our medium and longer term climate strategy for review by our Board. We will share the results of that evaluation when completed.

			We work closely with our employees and contractors to promote a strong safety culture and continuously improve our performance. Since early 2020, a multidisciplinary Hess emergency response team has been overseeing our plans and precautions to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in our work environment.
			<br><br>
			In 2020, our company achieved a 19% reduction in our workforce total recordable incident rate compared with 2019, driven by a decrease in contractor incidents, and a 50% reduction in our workforce lost time incident rate. We reached a five year low in our severe and significant safety incident rate, achieving a nearly 10% reduction from 2019. We also continued to improve our process safety performance in 2020, with zero Tier 1 process safety incidents.
			<br><br>
			The safety performance of our contractors, who represent approximately 70% of our total workforce hours, is critical to achieving our safety goals. In 2020, we progressed our engagement efforts with many of our contractors to ensure alignment on the standards expected in Hess operations and to work together on opportunities for improvement.

		As part of our company’s commitment to social responsibility we participate in multistakeholder initiatives designed to advance transparency, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. For example, we are a member of IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry organization for environmental and social issues, as well as the U.N. Global Compact and the Global Compact U.S. Network, which share best practices in sustainable business conduct across the private sector. In keeping with our company values and purpose, we have a longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace and through social investment programs that make a positive and lasting impact on the communities where we operate primarily through education and work skills development. In 2020, we also provided financial and volunteer support for a variety of COVID-19 community relief efforts.

		In Houston, Hess continued to invest in its LEAP (Learn, Engage, Advance, Persevere) educational program and related initiatives, making adjustments for a virtual learning environment due to the pandemic
		<br><br>
		Since 2013, Hess has contributed approximately $7.4 million to support students in Houston’s underserved Magnolia Park and Second Ward communities. In 2020, Hess also launched a scholarship program and awarded five minority graduating seniors in Houston full scholarships to pursue four year college degrees. In partnership with area nonprofit Second Servings, Hess employees prepared and distributed more than 125,000 meals in 2020 to Texas families facing food insecurity during the pandemic. As part of the company’s support for societal changes to address racial inequities, Hess donated $200,000 to help establish the Program Management Office for the Houston Complete Communities Initiative. Plans are underway to more than double our current investment in education and extend programs and services to a third economically disadvantaged Houston community.
		<br>
		In North Dakota, for the third year in a row, we provided Hess toy trucks to every elementary school in the state together with a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) curriculum designed by Baylor College of Medicine’s Center for Educational Outreach. Hess contributed $100,000 to the Great Plains Food Bank, which had seen an unprecedented 45% increase in need across North Dakota and western Minnesota due to the pandemic.
		<br><br>
		In Malaysia, Hess supports the My Kasih Foundation “Love My School” Student Bursary Program, which provides financial assistance to underprivileged children. We also fund the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program, which places recent graduates from U.S. universities into public secondary schools in the Kelantan region to teach English. In response to the pandemic, we contributed more than 60,000 units of personal protective supplies including face masks, hand sanitizers and medical gloves to the country’s frontline workers and donated approximately 4,000 meals to frontline workers and underserved communities.

	In Guyana, Hess and its partners contributed more than $3 million in 2020 as part of ongoing efforts to build capacity in the local Guyanese economy as well as COVID-19 relief efforts. As we move forward, we are committed to building on these initiatives in 2021 by investing an additional $8 million into the workforce development, education, health and agricultural programs already established.

			<p>
			We see transparency in reporting as an important part of being a trusted energy partner. We have been publishing a sustainability report since 1997, which is prepared in accordance with the Core option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. 
			<br><br> 
			Our reporting aligns with a number of frameworks including oil and gas industry metrics from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and TCFD recommendations.
			<br><br>
			In 2020, we continued to be recognized for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. For example, we achieved leadership status in the CDP’s annual Global Climate Analysis for the 12th consecutive year and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 11th consecutive year.
